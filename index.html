									<h2>Welcome</h2>
									<p>Imperial College Design Collective</p>
								</header>
								
								<p>The Imperial College Design Collective (ICDC) is a student run interdisciplinary creative platform. 
								As a group of passionate scientists, engineers, and designers, we seek to greatly further our scientific 
								knowledge and practical (workshop) experience whilst at Imperial College. ICDC holds weekly hands-on workshops, 
								organises talks from industry leaders, as well as visits to museum exhibitions and various design studios.</p>
								<p>Since ICDC's genesis in the summer of 2012, we have been inspired by the themes of Enhancing Cycling in London, Sustainability, The Interactive City and many more. 
								<br>We have held talks by Andrew Waugh, Simon Manchipp, Chris Wise, and Kathryn Firth to name but a few. Our flagship event comes with a talk from Foster + Partners who we have hosted for 3 years now, each time giving us a new perspective.
								We are very proud that the James Dyson Foundation have also run exclusive workshops with us for two years running giving our members exciting design challenges as well as insight into their own practice.
								<br>With office visits to IDEO in Clerkenwell and Pentagram in Notting Hill, our members were immersed into a universe of brilliance in creating processes, objects and spaces that enhance our experience as human beings.
								</br></br>
								Join our <a href="http://eepurl.com/5K7p5" target="_blank">mailing list</a> and like our 
								<a href="http://www.facebook.com/ICDCollective" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> to stay up to date with us.</p>

											<h4>Trip: The Design Museum</h4>
											
											<p>ICDC are EXCITED to host a trip to The Design Museum with discounted tickets for members! There are 3 great exhibitions going on: The Cycle Revolution, Designers in Residence Series and Designer of the Year 2015. The material being showcased is world class, and not to be missed.</p>

											<h4>Workshop: DIY MIDI Controller</h4>
											
											<p>After demoing with ICAH and Artsfest, here it is - the DIY MIDI Controller workshop ! Learn how to build your own 4x4 USB MIDI pad controller. These Arduino-controlled pads allow you to control all kinds of things in music software (think Logic, Ableton or GarageBand) like playing virtual drumkits, or instruments, or triggering loops to play during a performance. The workshop will give you all the parts to make your own and we'll assemble them together.</p>

											<p>Create an outlandish new design for a bike - it doesn't have to be mechanically sound, it just has to push the boundaries of your imagination.

											<h4>Copenhagen</h4>
											<p>2014-15 was a great year for ICDC and to end it on a high we went on our first ever tour to Copenhagen!
											The capital of simple, practical, and elegant Nordic design, Copenhagen has a lot to offer for anyone interested in design. 
											<br>
											We explored the city by day and by night, by land and by sea, by bicycle and by <a href="https://me-mover.com/">me-mover</a>. <br>What we discovered? <br>Ourselves.
